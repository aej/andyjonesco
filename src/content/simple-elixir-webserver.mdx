In this article we will create a simple webserver in Elixir, run it locally, then bundle it ready for production.

Ensure that you have Elixir installed. If not, follow the steps for your setup here: [https://elixir-lang.org/install.html](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html)

## Create a barebones project

Run the following command to create a new Elixir project:

`mix new simple_server --sup`

`simple_server` is the name of our application.

`--sup` will provision the project as an [Elixir Application](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/1.13/Application.html).  In Elixir, an "Application" is a running program. It has a life cycle where it can be _loaded_, _started_ and _stopped_. Components of the application are started by adding them to the `application.ex` file. You can think of this as the [entrypoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entry_point) to any Elixir program.

You should see the following output:

```bash
➜  mix new simple_server --sup
* creating README.md
* creating .formatter.exs
* creating .gitignore
* creating mix.exs
* creating lib
* creating lib/simple_server.ex
* creating lib/simple_server/application.ex
* creating test
* creating test/test_helper.exs
* creating test/simple_server_test.exs

Your Mix project was created successfully.
You can use "mix" to compile it, test it, and more:

    cd simple_server
    mix test

Run "mix help" for more commands.
```

Let's follow the instructions of the mix command and run the tests in our new application to make sure everything is installed correctly:

```bash
cd simple_server
mix test
```

If successful, we will see the following output:

```bash
➜ mix test
Compiling 2 files (.ex)
Generated simple_server app
..
Finished in 0.01 seconds (0.00s async, 0.01s sync)
1 doctest, 1 test, 0 failures

Randomized with seed 57434
```

## Install _Plug_ and _Bandit_

We will be using two libraries to build our minimal webserver - [Plug](https://hex.pm/packages/plug) and [Bandit](https://hex.pm/packages/bandit).

**Bandit** is our http server - it will handle the HTTP socket connections for us.

**Plug** is a specification for composing web applications in Elixir. A Plug-based web application is a series of `plugs`, each of which does _something_ with an http-request. Plug makes it easy for us to read and set the http headers, body & more. Its very similar to [WSGI](https://wsgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)/[ASGI](https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) in Python, or [Rack](https://github.com/rack/rack) in Ruby.

Add Plug and Bandit to the dependencies in `mix.exs`

```elixir
defp deps do
  [
    {:bandit, "~> 0.7.7"},
    {:plug, "~> 1.14"}
  ]
end
```

The latest versions are currently `0.7.7` and `1.14` respectively, but you can check the latest versions on [hex.pm](https://hex.pm) and use those.

Fetch the dependencies using

```bash
mix deps.get
```

You should see something like the following in your terminal:

```bash
➜  mix deps.get

  thousand_island 0.6.7
  websock 0.5.2

* Getting mime (Hex package)
* Getting plug_crypto (Hex package)
* Getting telemetry (Hex package)
* Getting hpax (Hex package)
* Getting thousand_island (Hex package)
* Getting websock (Hex package)
```


## Create our simple webserver

Create a new file in the `lib/simple_server` called `router.ex` and add the following code:

```bash
touch lib/simple_server/router.ex
```

```elixir
defmodule SimpleServer.Router do
  use Plug.Router

  plug(Plug.Logger)

  plug(:match)
  plug(:dispatch)

  get "/" do
    send_resp(conn, 200, "Hello, world!")
  end

  match _ do
    send_resp(conn, 404, "Not found")
  end
end
```

`use Plug.Router` will turn this module into a `Plug.Router` - It gives us a nice way to match on routes and send responses.

`plug(:match)` instructs our router to `match` the incoming requests against the routes defined in the router.

`plug(:dispatch)` instructs our router to dispatch requests which it matches.

While in this simple example the `match` and `dispatch` plugs might feel like an extra complication, practically defining these plugs lets us hook into the router life-cucle by defining actions which can run before `match`, after `dispatch` or in-between. For example we might want to read an HTTP Authorization header and validate it before we match the request to a route. This logic could be defined as a new `plug` before the `match` plug.

We define a single route which will return the string "Hello World!" with an HTTP 200 response for any `GET` request  at `"/"` .

We also define a catch-all `match` clause at the end - any request which does not match  `HTTP GET /` will return an HTTP 404 response with the string "Not found".

## Connect our Plug to Bandit

We're almost there! Now we need to tell Bandit to run our `SimpleServer.Router` as an HTTP webserver.

As mentioned previously, the `application.ex` file is the entrypoint for all Elixir applications so we will add Bandit and our router to the list of `children`:

```elixir {4}
@impl true
def start(_type, _args) do
  children = [
+   {Bandit, plug: SimpleServer.Router}
  ]

  opts = [strategy: :one_for_one, name: SimpleServer.Supervisor]
  Supervisor.start_link(children, opts)
end
```

This tells our Elixir application to start the Bandit webserver and use the `SimpleServer.Router` as our plug.

We can finally test our server:

```bash
mix run --no-halt
```

If all goes well, we should see the logs of our server running

```bash
11:10:14.931 [info] Running SimpleServer.Router with Bandit 0.7.7 at 0.0.0.0:4000 (http)
```

Visit `localhost:4000` in the browser and you should see "Hello World!".

In the server logs we should be able to see request logs

```bash
11:13:08.541 [info] GET /
11:13:08.542 [info] Sent 200 in 1ms
11:13:08.665 [info] GET /favicon.ico
11:13:08.669 [info] Sent 404 in 4ms
```

## Create our production build

In Elixir a packaged, production-ready build is called a [Release](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/config-and-releases.html#releases).

Creating our production build is as simple as

```bash
mix release
```

We will see the following output in our terminal:

```bash
➜  mix release
* assembling simple_server-0.1.0 on MIX_ENV=dev
* skipping runtime configuration (config/runtime.exs not found)

Release created at _build/dev/rel/simple_server

    # To start your system
    _build/dev/rel/simple_server/bin/simple_server start

Once the release is running:

    # To connect to it remotely
    _build/dev/rel/simple_server/bin/simple_server remote

    # To stop it gracefully (you may also send SIGINT/SIGTERM)
    _build/dev/rel/simple_server/bin/simple_server stop

To list all commands:

    _build/dev/rel/simple_server/bin/simple_server
```

As the output tells us, this creates a directory in `_build/dev/rel/simple_server` with everything we need to run the server in production.

One gotcha worth keeping in mind is that the release can only be run on a server with the same operating system as where it was built. So if you want to run your application on a debian-linux server, you will need to run the `mix release` command on a debian-linux machine.
